            <h3>IMPORTANT COVID-19 SLT UPDATE:
            The international SLTs have been POSTPONED until late 2021/early 2022. We will NOT be having trips to Lima, Peru or Kilimanjaro, Tanzania this school year.
            INSTEAD MEDLIFE International is hosting VIRTUAL and (pending national COVID-19 travel restrictions) DOMESTIC SLTs.

            <h1>About Our Service Learning Trips</h1>
            <p>Our service learning trips are more than a mission trip. A MEDLIFE Mobile Clinic brings free,
                high-quality healthcare directly to communities who lack access to basic health services. Staffed by
                local practitioners, clinics offer basic medical treatment and preventative screens and are designed to
                find patients who are in need of long-term assistance. Volunteers shadow medical professionals, help in
                the running of the clinic and learn about local medical practices, global medicine and the effect of
                poverty on health.</p>

                    <h1>What is a Virtual SLT? </h1>
                    <p>The virtual SLTs provide a unique opportunity to learn more about the effects COVID-19
                        has had in other parts of the world, like Peru. You will get to spend a week interacting with community leaders and medical professionals
                        that will walk you through how they are handeling the pandemic. You will also get to network with MEDLIFE members at many different chapters!
                        Plus, the entire cost of the SLT will go towards mitigating the effects of food insecurity in the area, which has increased dramatically due to the pandemic 
                        For a better idea of what the Virtual SLT will entail, check out this video made by MEDLIFE International!

                   <h1>What is a Domestic SLT?</h1>
                   <p>The domestic SLTs will hopefully allow you to experience a service learning trip in person! Given the varying levels
                       of vaccination accessibility to members of the communities we usually serve internationally, MEDLIFE's International 
                       service learning trips have been postponed. They are hopeful, however, that it will be safe to travel domestically 
                       by this summer. As a result, MEDLIFE International is introducing three new domestic service learning opportunities 
                       in Yosemite (California), Grand Canyon (Arizona) & Manitoulin Island (Toronto, Canada).
